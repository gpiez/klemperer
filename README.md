# klemperer

Integrate orbits of n-body Klemperer Rosettas, using a 4th order gravitational integrator.

n               - number of satellite bodies (not counting the central mass)
central mass    - in multiples of the mass of a satellite
lock view       - align the axis satellite-central horizontally
log2(step)      - time step parameter, incrementing this by one doubles the step size
